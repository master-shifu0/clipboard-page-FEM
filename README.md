## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

-I fixed some of the accessibility issues that my last solution had. This makes the website more accessible to people with disabilities  

### Continued development

I think i've had enough of plain html, css and vanilla JS

now i want to learn how to use a framework/library( most likely react)
